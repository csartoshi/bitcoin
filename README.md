# My Proof-of-Work: Perpetually Falling Down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole
***

"I will continue my quest to consume as much information as possible about this new ecosystem, but have long since given up the goal of understanding bitcoin.

The faster I run toward the finish line, the further it moves away from me. While some people in this space are more confident than others about its future direction, the truth is that we‚Äôre blazing new trails and learning as we move forward.  

You don‚Äôt understand bitcoin, and that‚Äôs OK ‚Äì _neither does anyone else._" -[Jameson Lopp](https://www.coindesk.com/nobody-understands-bitcoin-thats-ok); [456,776 BH](https://blockstream.info/block/0000000000000000016827e9a4c094eb3f2d85ac18a85e05506e257b2daf8e1f)

When I first started my journey down the bitcoin rabbit hole in 2015, I felt the same way as many others in their first brush with bitcoin: *_there's absolutely no way this will work_*.  I began reading everything I could find, which was very little at the time, to try to understand this novel concept.  After 6 months of this, I bought my first $5 worth of bitcoin just to play around with.  Little did I know then that the "splinter in my mind" had been implanted, and I have been expecting to wake up ever since.

Like many others, after over 5 years of falling down the bitcoin rabbit hole I've come to realize that bitcoin is one of the most important advancements in human civilization.  It is a paradigm-shifting invention (or disovery, as some have argued) that will re-shape humanity for centuries to come - on par with fire, electricity, and the printing press.  Because of this, I've recently exited the corporate world and reoriented my entire life around working on bitcoin.  I've resonated with Jameson Lopp's above piece as I think about the best way to share my bitcoin knowledge to prospective partners, investors and employers.  I'm convinced that nobody fully understands bitcoin, we can only reach deeper levels of understanding and iterate on the perspectives that we previously had, but most have not put in the work to try.  My goal here is to catalog my own adventures down the bottomless bitcoin rabbit hole - serving as my own "proof-of-work".  Like the protocol itself, my bitcoin journey never ends, it only grows and evolves block by block
